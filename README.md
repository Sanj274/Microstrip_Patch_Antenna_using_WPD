CIRCULARLY POLARIZED DUAL FEED MICROSTRIP PATCH ANTENNA  USING WILKINSON POWER DIVIDER AT 5.5 GHz 

The primary objective of this project is to design and evaluate the performance of a 
circularly polarized dual-feed microstrip patch antenna integrated with a Wilkinson 
power divider (WPD) for enhanced wireless communication applications. The specific 
goals of this project include: 
1. **Achieve Circular Polarization:** Design a square-shaped microstrip patch antenna 
with dual orthogonal feeds to achieve circular polarization, which improves signal 
stability and quality, particularly in environments prone to multipath interference. 
2. **Optimize Antenna Parameters:** Determine the optimal dimensions and 
configuration of the antenna to meet specific frequency, gain, and bandwidth 
requirements, ensuring effective signal transmission and reception. 
3.** Implement Wilkinson Power Divider**: Integrate a Wilkinson power divider to 
equally distribute power between the dual feeds, thus maintaining consistent 
performance and improving the efficiency of the antenna. 
4. **Evaluate Performance through Simulation:** Use ANSYS software to simulate 
and analyze the antennaâ€™s performance in terms of return loss, axial ratio, gain, 
and radiation pattern to verify that it meets the targeted specifications. 
5. **Suitability for High-Frequency Applications:** Ensure that the designed antenna 
is well-suited for high-frequency applications such as satellite communication, 
mobile communication, and other wireless systems requiring circular polarization.
